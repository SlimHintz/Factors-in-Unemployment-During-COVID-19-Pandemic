# Phase3-Proj

**Authors**: Tim Hintz, Dan Valenzuela

## Overview

In 2020, the world was hit by the Sars-Covid-2. To prevent the spread of the disease, US state governments locked down the economy in March. As a result of the pandemic, millions of people lost their jobs. The current research seeks to identify early signs that households may lose their employment and in turn aid in the allocation of resources before the need is desperate.

## Business Problem

The allocation of state and federal resources to help those families who need it most has been largely mismanaged at the federal level [source]. Being able to predict which families and individuals are going to be in most dire need of financial assistence three months in advance will aid in providing the government with the necessary information for the distribution of relief funds. 

## Data

All data used in this study comes from the `Current Population Survey` (CPS) conducted by `The United States Census Bureau`. The CPS tracks upwards of 60,000 households accross the US using multistaged stratified statistical sampling. Each house hold is followed for four months at a time.

The census data had high integrity and was clean at time of retrieval.
